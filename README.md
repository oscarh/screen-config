## Building

Requires Rust 1.88+.

```sh
cargo build --release
```

The binary is at `target/release/smc`.

## Installation

```sh
cp target/release/smc ~/.local/bin/
```

To make the window float in Sway, add to `~/.config/sway/config`:

```
for_window [app_id="simple_sway_monitor_config"] floating enable
```

## Usage

Launch `smc` from a terminal or application launcher. Click a monitor in the
canvas to select it, drag to reposition. Monitors swap live when dragged past
each other. On release, the monitor snaps to the nearest edge or alignment of
its neighbors.

Select a resolution from the dropdown and click Apply to send the configuration
to Sway. Mirror mode sets all outputs to position 0,0 with a common resolution.
